Installation

$ ./configure && make

and as root

# make install

That's all! Run 'rejoystick' and your good to go. 


Instruction

$ rejoystick

Click the button you want to assign (e.g. Button 0) and then click "Change key". Then click a keyboard key.

After you have done that will all the buttons you want to bind (or whatever you want to call it) click "OK". That
will save your layout to $HOME/.rejoystickrc which is in plain text. In the future I will make it possible to
run rejoystick without the gui and just edit the rc file but that's in the future.

When you have clicked "OK" the program quits. Now, to run the "real" rejoystick app, simply run
$ rejoystick -d

This will run in the background, wait for joystick events and then translate. No gui. 
Have to be killed and with something like "killall -9 rejoystick"




Thanks

A BIG thanks to Nicholas Niro who helped me out several times with rearranging the architecture. The autotools can 
be hard to understand/master and it's real nice when you get help with that. Thanks!

I also want to thank Nathan for qjoypad and for commenting it a lot. It has helped me a bit with my work with rejoystick.



Misc

And yeah. This is a ripoff of qjoypad. I started out doing rejoystick because I thought qjoypad was a bit bloated
(and it didn't want to compile for me) but now rejoystick is getting bloated to. But I will try to making it possible
to run without the gui (if you _really_ hate gtk) and then only depend upon SDL.

Have fun!
